# AI_Playground
This project is all about AI.<br/>
The world will be randomly generated with grass and water tiles.
You have a bar at the top, this bar has a selection of creatures... or at least... it will.
Drag a creature from the bar onto a tile on the map to spawn an instance of that creature.
Finally watch the world fall apart as your 100 000 foxes hunt the rabbits to extinction
